    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Terena Blasberg</h2>
    <p>Hi there! I'm a happy girl who loves changing! For sure until the end of the Bootcamp you will see me with a new hair color or a new piercing!</p>
    <p>I'm from Brazil but half of my heart is from Venezuela. I got my Chemical Engineer bachelors there and I miss very much my friends and the Venezuelan culture.</p>
    <p>Life taught me how to be resilient and start over. This is my second career change, after moving to Florida. From oil industry, passing through customer service to tech, I'm on my way to live my dream!</p>
